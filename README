Package %{scl_name} provides MongoDB server delivered as a Software
Collection. For more information about Software Collections,
see the scl(1) man page. By installing the %{scl_name} collection,
you will get the minimum working set of packages to have a working
MongoDB server.

Usage: scl enable %{scl} 'mongod'

Software Collections allow you to build and execute applications
which are not located in the filesystem root hierarchy,
but are stored in an alternative location, which is
%{_scl_root} in case of the %{scl_name} collection.

This package provides the mongod server daemon and the mongos
sharding server daemon software, default configuration files and
init scripts.

When you want to work with the %{scl_name} collection, use the scl
utility (see the scl(1) man page for usage) to enable the scl
environment.

Configuration for the %{scl_name} software collection is located under
%{_sysconfdir} .

Examples:
scl enable %{scl_name} 'command --arg'
  Run a specific command with the argument --arg within the %{scl_name}
  software collections environment.

scl enable %{scl_name} 'mongod'
  Run mongod from the %{scl_name} software collection.

scl enable %{scl_name} 'bash'
  Run an interactive shell wherein the %{scl_name} software collection
  is enabled.

scl enable %{scl_name} 'man mongod'
  Show man pages for the mongod command, which is a part of the
  %{scl_name} software collection.
